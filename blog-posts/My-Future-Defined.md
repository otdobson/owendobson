Preface
The Keystone State Challenge Academy has provided a great foundation for self improvement while fostering a development of my state of mind. My future options have been greatly abundant and choicy, however I have decided on a set and stone path with the help of some guidance from advisors and people. 

Education Endeavors 
Following enrollment at the Keystone State Challenge Academy, during the summer I plan to conduct business operations, in a way that can generate an audience and not additional income, as well as interns as labor to comply with legal requirements/restrictions and parents' visions. College visitation and research will be conducted but not limited to tours, application processes, scholarships, and other opportunities. By the end of the challenge program I plan to be operational and fully independent without my medication allowing for military options. 

My summer will consist of the Civil Air Patrol Program enrollment, enlistment to the youth part time national guard program as well as conducting various research projects and studies while providing consistency from the quasi military programs; living by the standards after the program can foster success and self discipline. During the summer I will work to obtain various certifications in different fields; primarily information technology.

My fall semester I will be attending the Franklin County Career Tech Center to study information system technology and take 1 HACC class to be paid for OVR with the possibility of taking more using my own investment monetary capital. I will have the ability and opportunity to obtain my driver's license in september of the fall semester allowing for easier access to transportation as well as commuting to the library after school; the shippensburg university library to conduct research and business operations in a quiet environment such as a study room, surrounded by resources. Applying for NYU early is also a goal this semester as well as preparing resources and materials during the summer.

My spring semester I will be able to take virtual high school classes and attend the Shippensburg University Dual Enrollment Program, known as ShipStart, $100 per credit with the added benefit of staying on campus due to HS classes being virtual. Due to missing vo tech level 3, I will be creating a virtual isolated cloud environment in k8s to provide training and knowledge following textbook procedures to earn my cisco certifications and others. During my free time at the university I can conduct research and business operations with the added benefit of the quiet environment. Due for graduation in spring of 2025.
The ability to also take a free HACC class is also a benefit of this spring semester.

Notes and additional information
The ability to take classes at HACC and Shippensburg university for a discount tuition allows for potential tuition cut off from the expense NYU admission process.


LLCS & Pseudo Entities/Business Operations

The process of treating yourself like a company has many benefits, which will contribute to success. The use of different complex military programs to gain experience and leadership, and to obtain a headstart as well as to provide benefits and tuition assistance to pay for college and obtain an officer position will be essential to my experience in creating and developing business ventures and hopefully going into politics in the future. 

My assets can be put in a limited liability company, a pseudo copy of myself for protection and more security as well as benefits; this way I can have myself separated from myself legally, allowing for me to organize my life and indirectly own my assets, I plan for my car to be owned by the limited liability company, a pseudo version of me. I plan to stop taking my meds during the KSCA, to endure the fact that I will have to be off of them eventually and what better place to do it than in a consistent isolated environment, where all remains constant, on a structured schedule teaching me how to work through myself without it.  The pseudo LLC allows for a last protection against potential issues, and allows for me to be eligible for more benefits. I always wanted to enter the art and science of the politics field, and building a military background is the most comprehensive way to go and a well respected way to go, in addition the military provides tuition assistance and coverage for my bachelors of technology, science and entrepreneurship at NYU, and concurrently allows for the advancement to an officer position.  The military provides benefits such as free housing, access to military bases which can include cheap hotels for less than 24 a night, cheap gas, and free gym membership. 

The pseudo LLC allows for a safe space for all my financials, assets, properties, and liabilities, and allows them to be different from me, while having the benefits of an LLC. Allowing for easy transfer of ownership upon death, and reassurance of limited  liability upon the event of seizure considering the idea of entering the business world. 

Using my accounting knowledge and entrepreneurship knowledge I know how to effectively and operationally conduct business endeavors which include but are not limited to legality, compliance, and organizational activities. 

The legal structure goes as follows: I own the pseudo entity, the pseudo entity owns the parent company, and the parent company owns all the Subsidiaries or the actual endeavors/ventures allowing for ease of use and research. 


The military enrollment also provides free taxes filing services, a financial advisor, a house downpayment, national parks free pass, free tickets to concerts, military discounts, a retirement which can include either a pension or a 401K.

The Spring Summer

During my summer I will be enrolled in many different educational practices, including NUPATHS to make up for missing careertech this sesmester and couresera options as well (I get full access through a partnerships).
